# 📚 Searching and Reporting in Databases

## ✅ Task 1: Comparison between Flat File System and Relational Database System

| Feature               | Flat File System                                        | Relational Database System (RDBMS)                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**         | Stores data in plain text files, often unstructured.   | Stores data in organized tables (rows and columns).                 |
| **Redundancy**        | High data duplication is common.                       | Low redundancy due to normalization and table relations.            |
| **Relationships**     | No relationships between data files.                   | Supports strong relationships using primary and foreign keys.       |
| **Efficiency**        | Slow to search, update, and manage.                    | Fast and efficient with large-scale data handling.                  |
| **Security**          | Very limited or no user access control.                | Built-in security features for access control and user management.  |
| **Backup & Recovery** | Manual backup process.                                 | Automated backup and recovery features available.                   |
| **Examples**          | CSV files, Excel sheets, simple logs.                  | Student Management Systems, Banking Systems, eCommerce Databases.   |

## ✅ Task 2: Mind Map - Advantages of DBMS

- 🔐 **Data Security**: Controls access and protects from unauthorized use.  
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Ensures accuracy and consistency.  
- ♻️ **Data Redundancy Control**: Prevents duplication by normalization.  
- 💾 **Backup & Recovery**: Automated and efficient data protection.  
- 👥 **Concurrency**: Allows multiple users to access data at the same time.  
- 🌐 **Data Sharing**: Enables sharing of data across applications/users.

## ✅ Task 3: Roles in Database Project

- 👓 **System Analyst**: Collects requirements, communicates with clients.  
- 🧠 **Database Designer**: Designs database schema and ERD.  
- 🧱 **Database Developer**: Implements tables, relationships, and SQL queries.  
- 🔐 **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Manages backups, security, and performance.  
- 💻 **Application Developer**: Develops apps that interact with the database.  
- 📊 **BI Developer**: Creates reports and dashboards from data.  

---

## ✅ Task 4: Types of Databases

- 📘 **Relational Databases**: Use tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
- 📗 **Non-Relational (NoSQL)**: Use documents/keys (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).  
- 🏢 **Centralized Database**: Stored and managed in one location.  
- 🌍 **Distributed Database**: Data stored across multiple locations.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Database**: Hosted online (e.g., Google Spanner, Amazon RDS).  

---

## ✅ Task 5: Cloud Databases

- ☁️ Cloud databases are hosted on cloud platforms, offering on-demand scalability and reliability.  
- 🌐 They allow global access and reduce the need for physical infrastructure.  
- 🛠️ Examples: Azure SQL Database, Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Spanner.  
- 🧩 Benefits include high availability, disaster recovery, and automatic scaling.  
- ⚠️ Challenges include data privacy, internet dependency, and cost management.

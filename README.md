Searching and Reporting in Databases
## Task 1: Comparison between Flat File System and Relational Database System

| Feature               | Flat File System                                        | Relational Database System (RDBMS)                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structure             | Stores data in plain text files, often unstructured.   | Stores data in organized tables (rows and columns).                 |
| Redundancy            | High data duplication is common.                       | Low redundancy due to normalization and table relations.            |
| Relationships         | No relationships between data files.                   | Supports strong relationships using primary and foreign keys.       |
| Efficiency            | Slow to search, update, and manage.                    | Fast and efficient with large-scale data handling.                  |
| Security              | Very limited or no user access control.                | Built-in security features for access control and user management.  |
| Backup & Recovery     | Manual backup process.                                 | Automated backup and recovery features available.                   |
| Real-life Examples    | CSV files, Excel sheets, simple logs.                  | Student Management Systems, Banking Systems, eCommerce Databases.   |


Task 2: Mind Map - Advantages of DBMS
•	• Data Security: Controls access and protects from unauthorized use.
•	• Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency.
•	• Data Redundancy Control: Prevents duplication by normalization.
•	• Backup & Recovery: Automated and efficient data protection.
•	• Concurrency: Allows multiple users to access data at the same time.
•	• Data Sharing: Enables sharing of data across applications/users.
Task 3: Roles in Database Project
•	• System Analyst: Collects requirements, communicates with clients.
•	• Database Designer: Designs database schema and ERD.
•	• Database Developer: Implements tables, relationships, and SQL queries.
•	• Database Administrator (DBA): Manages backups, security, and performance.
•	• Application Developer: Develops apps that interact with the database.
•	• BI Developer: Creates reports and dashboards from data.
Task 4: Types of Databases
•	• Relational Databases: Use tables (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
•	• Non-Relational (NoSQL): Use documents/keys (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
•	• Centralized Database: Stored and managed in one location.
•	• Distributed Database: Data stored across multiple locations.
•	• Cloud Database: Hosted online (e.g., Google Spanner, Amazon RDS).
Task 5: Cloud Databases
•	• Cloud databases are hosted on cloud platforms, offering on-demand scalability and reliability.
•	• They allow global access and reduce the need for physical infrastructure.
•	• Examples: Azure SQL Database, Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Spanner.
•	• Benefits include high availability, disaster recovery, and automatic scaling.
•	• Challenges include data privacy, internet dependenc

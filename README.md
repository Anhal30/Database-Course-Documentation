## Task 1: Comparison between Flat File System and Relational Database System

| Feature               | Flat File System                                        | Relational Database System (RDBMS)                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structure             | Stores data in plain text files, often unstructured.   | Stores data in organized tables (rows and columns).                 |
| Redundancy            | High data duplication is common.                       | Low redundancy due to normalization and table relations.            |
| Relationships         | No relationships between data files.                   | Supports strong relationships using primary and foreign keys.       |
| Efficiency            | Slow to search, update, and manage.                    | Fast and efficient with large-scale data handling.                  |
| Security              | Very limited or no user access control.                | Built-in security features for access control and user management.  |
| Backup & Recovery     | Manual backup process.                                 | Automated backup and recovery features available.                   |
| Real-life Examples    | CSV files, Excel sheets, simple logs.                  | Student Management Systems, Banking Systems, eCommerce Databases.   |
